            <h2>Summary</h2>
             
             
              <p>
                Lions are large cats with short, tawny coats, white underparts, and long tails with a black tuft at the end. They are male cats with manes. Three year-old male lions   grow manes that vary in color from black to blond. Manes tend to be fuller in open habitats. Adult males typically weigh 189 kg the heaviest male was record weighed 272 kg at Mount Kenya which weigh 126 kg on average. The average male height is 1.2 m and the average female height is 1.1 m. Length ranges from 2.4 to 3.3 m and tail length ranges from 0.6 to 1.0 m the longest male lion recorded was 3.3 m. Cubs have brown a spots on a grayish coat until the age of three months spots may remain on stomach, especially in east Africa. Albinism does occur in some populations, but there are no published records of black fur in lions. Adult lions have 30 total teeth and adult females have four mammae. Asiatic lions are slightly smaller than African lions and have shorter manes, thicker elbow and tail tufts, and longitudinal skin folds on their stomachs. Although Asiatic lions are genetically distinct from African lions, the genetic difference between the two species is smaller than that between human races. 
African lions live in most of sub-Saharan Africa except in desert and rainforest habitats. Lions were once exterminated from South Africa, where they remain in Kruger and Kalahari Gemsbok National Parks and possibly some other protected areas. Lions once ranged throughout southwest Asia and north Africa. Asiatic lions belong to the single remaining subspecies in this region. Once roaming from Greece to central India, Asiatic lions persist in the Gir forest of northwest India. In addition to the asiatic subspecies, many taxonomists contend that there are five extant African subspecies. Each subspecies is identified by geographic region. Panthera leo senegalensis (west African or Senegalese lions), azandica (north east Congo lions), bleyenberghi (Katanga, Angolan, or south Congo lions), and krugeri (south African or Transvaal lions). Panthera leo krugeri includes Kalahari lions (sometimes denoted as verneyi).  There are East African lions (nubica). These animals have been categorized as Somali lions (somaliensis), Masai lions (mas-saicus), Serengeti lions (massaicus), Congo lions ( hollisteri), and Abyssinian lions ( roosevelti). It should be noted, however, that there is some debate as to the validity of the African subspecies classifications, leaving only the Asiatic subspecies,  persica, uncontested. 

Lions are predatory carnivores. They usually hunt in groups, but the actual killing is done by an individual lion. They frequently bring down prey much bigger than they are themselves. Showy males have more difficulty hunting than females because of their conspicuousness; therefore females in a pride do the majority of hunting. Males are still more aggressive during feeding than are females, even though they are less likely to have killed the prey. Individual prides tend to have their own eating preferences. Some prides tend to target large prey such as Cape buffalo and giraffe. Lions that are not able to capture large prey will eat birds, rodents, fish, ostrich eggs, amphibians as reptiles. Lions also actively scavenge, taking cues from hyenas and vultures. Serengeti research has shown that individual lions succeed in their hunting 17% of the time, whereas group hunts succeed 30% of the time.

                  The lion is a deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. It has variety in color of their fur which 
                  goes from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown however, their color of underside is generally lighter. Whereas, 
                  a new born lion has dark spots which fade as the cub reaches adulthood but, some faint spots can be seen on legs and underparts. 
                  Male lion have broader heads and a prominent mane which grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, 
                  and chest. This mane is usually brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs. Lastly, lion’s tail ends in a dark, hairy

            <h2>Distribution and habitat </h2> 
            <p> This African lion stay in scattered population across Sub-Saharan Africa. This lion rarely enter closed forests and it prefers grassy plains and savannahs. They are not found in rain forests. Now, the Asiatic lion survives only in and around Gir National Park in Gujarat, Western India. This lion’s has mix habitat of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous scrub forest   .</p>

            <h2>Behavior and ecology </h2> 
          <p> Lions are lazy as they spend most of their time resting, they are inactive for about 20 hours per day but, they can be active at any time. They are active after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming and defecating. Their intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, mostly when hunting takes place. They spend fifty minutes eating and average of two hours walking a day.</p>
